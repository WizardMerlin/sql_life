多表删除
DELETE tb_name[.*][,tb_name[.*]]...FROM table_references [where where_condition]
(平常正规的删除是: delete from table_name where expression)
  先看看哪些数据重复了:
      select t.goods_id,t.goods_name from tdb_goods as t group by t.goods_name having count(t.goods_name)>1;  //goods_id为18、19的各重复一次
     
      select t1.goods_id as id1,t2.goods_id as id2
          from  tdb_goods as t1
          inner join
             (select t.goods_id,t.goods_name from tdb_goods as t group by t.goods_name having count(t.goods_name)>1) as t2
          on t1.goods_name = t2.goods_name;     //18和21重复,19和22重复
   
      //重复的，只保留id小的,所以把id偏大的两个查出来
      select t1.goods_id as id1,t2.goods_id as id2
          from  tdb_goods as t1
          inner join
             (select t.goods_id,t.goods_name from tdb_goods as t group by t.goods_name having count(t.goods_name)>1) as t2
          on t1.goods_name = t2.goods_name
          where t1.goods_id > t2.goods_id;
(多表查询太麻烦了，所以查出来后，还是用delete from tb_name where condition)
